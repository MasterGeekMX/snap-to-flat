In order to pinpoint what is going wrong with the scrip, please provide us with three pieces of information:

+ **Version of Ubuntu**, like 22.04.3 or 23.10, for example
+ **Flavour of Ubuntu**, like Kubutu or Ubuntu mate, for example.
+ **New installation or used one**, and if so, which apps you installed as snap

Thank you!
